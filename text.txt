Minecraft server!

Rules : <a href="
Welcome to Discord, I'm so glad you're here smile The reason I made a Discord server was because I wanted a place where people could come together and get to know each other (and me)! I want to continue to build the best community on YouTube. Here a couple things to keep in mind as you chat here!

➤ Self Advertisement is not allowed

If your own YouTube channel or Discord server is brought up organically in a conversation, cool. But please don't be that person who goes out of there way to talk about that stuff here when you don't need to smiley You will never find me promoting my channel or Discord server in other people's Discord servers, so I expect the same from you guys.

➤ No spamming chats

Excessive posting of irrelevant images or taking up voice channels with white noise.

➤ Keep Your Privacy

You are the one responsible for the conversations that take place in your DM, the server takes no responsibility for the same.

➤ Discussion On Sensitive Matters
